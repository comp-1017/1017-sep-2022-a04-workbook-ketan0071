            <h2>What is Honey?</h2>
            <p>
                A single cell of honeycomb is filled with the concentrated 
                nectar of thousands of flowers, the healthiest and rawest
                form of honey available. A delicacy of nature straight from
                the source, our Raw Honeycomb is hand-cut from the frame 
                and boxed, with no additional treatment or processing. 
                Honeycomb paired with cheeses, fruit, and edible flowers
                is a gorgeous and delicious spread for guests. Honeycomb
                is 100% edible. KSA Kosher Certified.
