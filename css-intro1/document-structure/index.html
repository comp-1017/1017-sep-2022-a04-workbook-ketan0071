				Bike on quiet roads over rolling hills through the heart of Tuscany.
                 Perhaps stopping for a long lunch at a local vineyard, medieval town

                and great food and wine at the end of a day's cycling make this tour a
                 perfect mix of what makes Tuscany great.
