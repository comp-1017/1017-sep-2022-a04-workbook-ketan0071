        <!-- the border="1" will add a deault border around the table and each cell 
				This is a known error, you may use this on your tables until we get to CSS -->
		<table border="1">
			<thread>
				<!-- the thread will indicate a line of column headers
                the cell tag for this line will be <th>
                the contents of the cell will be bolded by default
            
                Optionally: one can have their head titles on the rows
                    here the developer uses the 1st column (general) as
                    the titles for the data.
                if you are designing your table in this fashion, then
                    a thread area is not needed, and the first cell on
                    your table body row will be a <th> cell-->
				<tr>
					<th>Host Name</th>
					<th>Bandwidth</th>
					<th>Price</th>
					<th>Money Back</th>
					<th>Coupon</th>
					<th>Rating</th>
					<!-- tbody contains the data for the table
                    each row represents a single row of table data
                    think of a grid system (tabular)
                    the text will not have any styling be default

                    see above for using <th> cell if you wish your headings
                        to appear on th erow instead of the column top

                    by default, you are expected to have one <td> cell for 
                        each <th> cell

                    <td> cells are grouped under a <tr> set of tags
                    <tr> is a table row
                    <td> is a data cell
                --></tr>
