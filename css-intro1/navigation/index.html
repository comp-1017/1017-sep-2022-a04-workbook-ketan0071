            if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag) 
            you would be in trouble using the tag.

        <h3>Anchor tag (a.k.a. linking to another page)</h3>
        <!-- blocked pair
            This is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the
            link tag
            One should NOT use the link tag because there is actually a <link>
            used in the <head> section
            The anchor tag can take you to a different location whether it 
            be on a different website, different page in the current website
            or a different location on the current page

            parameters:
            href: points to the desired location
            target: indicates the browser page display option
                    default is same display page tab
                    _blank will open a new browser tab(page) 

            Absolute adressing is a complete fixed file path
                drive:/folder/.../folder/filename.ext

                relative address begins at a specific point
                for websites, it is the "top of the website"
                reference to the desired file name is done by specifiying the appropriate folder to desired file
                NO DRIVE

                movement within a relative address
                -if only the file name is given, the location is within the
                same folder

            -movement down the file structure is by /foldername
            -movement up the is by using .. for each folder level to ascend

            Same folder
            ="filename/extention"

            Lower folder
            ="nextleveldownfoldername/nextlevelfoldername/foldername.ext"
            from one lower folder on a different branch 
            ..for each level that need to be ascended
            ="../../..nextleveldownfoldername/filename.ext"

            combine the anchor tag and the image as the anchor tag image
